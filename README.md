Icons for a web chat

I was thinking 16x16 with transparent backgrounds. File format doesn't matter to me.

## Button Icons:
- User options ... A gear
- Rules ... An exclamation point in a triangle
- Help ... A question mark in a circle
- Server settings ... Not sure. Another gear? Different somehow? (*showing racks and a gear*)
- Clear chat ... Not sure *an erasure*
- Logout ... An X *an exit door*
- User info ... A lowercase i in a circle (*an  8-figure with an i*)
- Kick user ... Not sure (*a yellow 8-figure with red cross*)
- Ban user ... Not sure (*a red 8-figure with black cross*)

#### Toggle Icons: (these should follow a pattern; like glowing vs. dim)
- Chat open ... A glowing circle. Maybe blue?
- Chat off ... Either a dim circle or a circle glowing red
- Registration on ... Not sure
- Registration off ... Not sure. Something glowing red?
- Gag on ... Not sure. Something glowing red?
- Gag off ... Not sure

- User away ... A glowing yellow circle
- User online ... A glowing green circle
- Chat paused ... Two glowing vertical bars
- Chat unpaused ... Two dim vertical bars
- Chat direction up ... A glowing up arrow
- Chat direction down ... Either a dim up arrow or a glowing down arrow
